# 🚢 Titanic Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, trends, and factors affecting passenger survival. Using Python and visualization techniques, the analysis explores relationships between features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To extract meaningful insights from the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visual exploration.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including:

* PassengerId
* Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass (Passenger class)
* Name
* Sex
* Age
* SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
* Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
* Ticket
* Fare
* Cabin
* Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

---

## 🔎 Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Loading

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

### 2. Data Understanding

* Checked data types and missing values
* Used `.info()` and `.describe()` functions

### 3. Data Exploration

* Value counts of categorical variables
* Distribution of numerical features

### 4. Visualization

* Histograms
* Boxplots
* Count plots
* Scatter plots
* Pairplot
* Correlation heatmap

### 5. Insight Extraction

Identified relationships between variables and survival.

## 📊 Key Findings

* Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
* First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
* Higher fare was associated with better survival chances.
* Most passengers were young adults.
* Socioeconomic status played a major role in survival.

---

## 📈 Conclusion

The analysis shows that survival on the Titanic was strongly influenced by gender, passenger class, and fare paid. Women and higher-class passengers were given priority during rescue operations.

---

## 📎 Outcome

This project demonstrates how Exploratory Data Analysis can uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies in real-world datasets using statistical methods and visualization.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install Python and required libraries:
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

---

## 📚 Future Improvements

* Handle missing values more effectively
* Build a machine learning model for survival prediction
* Perform feature engineering
